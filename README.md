# Bootstrap Grids

This is essentially a fork of [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), but only with the grids/layout components.

Current version references Bootstrap Sass 3.3.4

### Note

Due to a little hiccup, the version numbers are slightly off because it's not possible to update a package with the same version number.

## Why?

I love Bootstrap and its grid system, but I rarely use any other components in most of my work.  It'd be easier for me if I could just import the Boostrap grids component only, and not have to deal with the rest.

I'm going to try and maintain this so it's up-to-date with the main Bootstrap repo.
